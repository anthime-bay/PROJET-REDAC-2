# Clone Twitter's Home Page

You are currently on the Readme of the twitter homepage clone that I made in HTML5 and CSS3. The goal of this project was to learn more about responsive and **HTML5 / CSS3** properties. One of the biggest difficulties I faced as a young front-end developer was structuring my code. As you can see Twitter is made in a vertical way which is not common for a website. One of the other difficulties I encountered was media queries for responsive due to its newness in my learning.
